# Vanilla JS example

Pure JavaScript SDK usage example.

## Trying it out

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

2. Serve `index.html`:

```bash
pnpm run serve
```

3. Run tunnel to locally launched HTTP server:

```bash
pnpm run tunnel
```

Tunnel command will return a URL which has to be used by [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather). Bind it to your Mini App and open the application.
