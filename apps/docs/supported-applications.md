# Supported applications

Currently, Telegram Mini Apps is presented on the wide list of Telegram
applications:

- [Telegram for Android](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram) `android`;
- [Telegram for iOS](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS) `ios`;
- [Telegram for macOS](https://github.com/overtake/TelegramSwift) `macos`;
- [Telegram Desktop](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop) `tdesktop`;
- [Telegram Web A](https://github.com/Ajaxy/telegram-tt) `web`;
- [Telegram Web K](https://github.com/morethanwords/tweb) `webk`;

Other applications either don't have implementation for Telegram Mini Apps, or
support it too poorly. This will probably be useful in the next sections of the
documentation.

::: info
As long as all applications are being developed separately, there may be variations in how they
implement the platform. If you encounter unexpected differences, please consider reporting
an [issue](https://github.com/Telegram-Mini-Apps/issues).
