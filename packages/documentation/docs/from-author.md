# From author

Hey developer! We spent a lot of time researching Telegram platform to create
something useful, something, that will help you to learn it much faster than we
did.

Telegram documentation is rather specific and takes a lot of time to find
something you really need. But what if you don't even know about functionality
you could use? How could you find it in some huge as universe documentation like
Telegram's one? This is another problem we are trying to solve.

You should remember, that this documentation was created by enthusiasts, not
Telegram developers. We could miss something, make mistakes, but we are doing
our best to improve your experience.

We wrote this documentation following this order:

1. Provide basic, surface information about platform
2. Dive deep into technical part to learn how platform works on low level
3. Smoothly decrease level of technical learning in favor of more feature-like
   style learning, referring to previously provided technical information.

This will make your studying more consistent and understandable.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we would like to say, that the result of our job is your
appreciation and attention. If you would like to support us, you could do it
