# Required technologies

Before starting to create application on Web Apps platform, it is important to
know what Web Apps is from its technical side. This will lead developer to
language and technologies selection.

Internally, Web Apps are usual web applications, which are displayed in WebView.
In other words, they are just a set of static files (mostly `.js`, `.css`
and `.html`). So, to create Web App, it is enough to learn standard front-end
development technologies, such as:

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

Really simple, isn't it? But to make much more serious and bigger applications,
we recommend to use more solid technologies, such as `TypeScript`, `React`,
`SCSS` etc.

So, if we want to create Web App, we should create standard web application with
any technologies stack. The only 1 thing Telegram needs from developer is
application URL to download it from. It will be used as source for WebView, what
will lead to application download and display.
