# Why

As we mentioned in previous section, Web Apps are add-on for Telegram Bots.
Telegram Bots is also known technology which provides functionality for wide
list of use-cases. You could create bot to buy a ticket in cinema, make him tell
user jokes, generate random number etc. In other words, bot can do whatever
developer think about.

The problem is, visual part of bots is not that good and functional as it could
be. Their current implementation is "console-like" which is more appropriate for
developers, not common users. That's the time for Web Apps to show up.

Using Web Apps, developers are allowed to create more user-friendly interfaces,
which are commonly used by usual users. With this technology, developer is still
able to communicate with bot behind Web App, but, additionally, he can provide
some more flexible interface to interact with.

## Conclusion

Web Apps are usually used when standard bot interface is not enough. Create Web
App when you want to make user life easier, when displaying several buttons is
not even close to functionality, you want to provide.
