# Web Apps

Web Apps is a technology created by developers of famous messenger Telegram. The
main it’s purpose is to provide developers more flexible communication channel
with users.

It may seem not clear, but Web Apps are not self-served services. First thing to
note is, technically, this technology is just an add-on for such already known
Telegram’s functionality as Telegram Bots. So, currently, it is not available to
create Web App without creating a Telegram Bot.

Platform offers high variety of available methods to communicate with Telegram
native application to make your applications look more native, allow them to
simulate native application's behaviour, and, finally, **mimic**
native applications.

concepts, workflow, features, libraries etc. It also contains tutorials and
notes for developers, which will be rather useful in process of application
development.
