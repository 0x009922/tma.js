# Libraries

There are already production-ready supported by community libraries which solve
all problems, connected with events handling and methods calling:

## [twa-bridge](../packages/twa-bridge)

Package which provides utilities to simplify communication flow between
frontend and Telegram native applications. It also solves some across-platform
data difference problems to protect developers code and save their time.

## [twa-sdk](../packages/twa-sdk/general-info)

Made from scratch TypeScript library for communication with Telegram Web Apps
functionality. Contains a lot of separate components which are
responsible for their own part of Telegram Web Apps ecosystem.

> This library already includes `twa-bridge` and provides much higher level
> API.
