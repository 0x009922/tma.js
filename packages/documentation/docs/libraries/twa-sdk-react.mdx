# @twa.js/sdk-react

React bindings for [client SDK](twa-sdk/about). Contains hooks, components and other
useful tools which allow usage of React along with Web Apps client SDK.
Tracks SDK components changes out of box.

<LibraryBadges pkg={'@twa.js/sdk-react'}/>

## Installation

Before everything, it is assumed, that you already installed `react` package
as long as this package has it as the peer dependency. Installation of SDK
itself is not required, `@twa.js/sdk-react` already includes it.

<NpmInstall pkg={'@twa.js/sdk-react'}/>

## Init

According to SDK documentation, it represents a set of components, which are
not initialized by default and a developer should create them by himself.
Additionally, the SDK provides the function called `init` which allows
developers not to think about "how do I even should create these
components?" and creates components by itself.

So, as you could think, the first thing we have to do is to provide application
the SDK functionality and allow it calling the initialization to get newly
created components. For this purpose, the component `SDKProvider` exists:

```typescript jsx
import React from 'react';
import {SDKProvider} from '@twa.js/sdk-react';

function Root() {
  return (
    <SDKProvider>
      <div>My application!</div>
    </SDKProvider>
  );
}
```

Internally, `SDKProvider` uses `init` function from `@twa.js/sdk`. It accepts
list of optional parameters described [here](twa-sdk/about#init):

```typescript jsx
import React from 'react';
import {InitOptions} from '@twa.js/sdk';
import {SDKProvider} from '@twa.js/sdk-react';

/**
 * Root component of the whole project.
 */
export function Root() {
  const options: InitOptions = {
    acceptScrollbarStyle: true,
    checkCompat: true,
    debug: true
  };

  return (
    <SDKProvider initOptions={options}>
      <div>My application!</div>
    </SDKProvider>
  );
}
```

In production, there is no need to use `initOptions` unless you have some
specific logic in your application. Usually, SDK does everything developer
needs by itself.

Usage of `SDKProvider` component allows its child elements to use hook
`useSDK` returning core SDK information:

```typescript jsx
import React from 'react';
import {SDKProvider, useSDK} from '@twa.js/sdk-react';

function App() {
  const sdk = useSDK();

  // Here, we can use SDK information.

  return <div>My application!</div>;
}

function Root() {
  return (
    <SDKProvider>
      <App/>
    </SDKProvider>
  );
}
```

Let's complicate previous example and add important logic connected with the
SDK lifecycle:

```typescript jsx
import React, {PropsWithChildren, useEffect} from 'react';
import {SDKProvider, useSDK, useBackButton, useWebApp} from '@twa.js/sdk-react';

/**
 * Part of application which is free of using SDK components.
 */
function App() {
  const backButton = useBackButton();
  const webApp = useWebApp();

  // When App is attached to DOM, lets show back button and
  // add click event handler, which will close application.
  useEffect(() => {
    const listener = () => webApp.close();
    backButton.on('click', listener);
    backButton.show();

    return () => {
      backButton.off('click', listener);
      backButton.hide();
    };
    // We know, that backButton and webApp will never change,
    // but let's follow React rules.
  }, [backButton, webApp]);

  return <div>My application!</div>;
}

/**
 * This component controls render of important part of application
 * which uses hooks, returning SDK components.
 */
function Loader({children}: PropsWithChildren) {
  const {didInit, components, error} = useSDK();

  // There were no calls of SDK's init function. It means, we did not
  // even try to do it.
  if (!didInit) {
    return <div>SDK init function is not yet called.</div>;
  }

  // Error occurred during SDK init.
  if (error !== null) {
    return <div>Something went wrong.</div>;
  }

  // If components is null, it means, SDK is not ready at the
  // moment and currently initializing. Usually, it takes like
  // several milliseconds or something like that, but we should
  // have this check.
  if (components === null) {
    return <div>Warming up SDK.</div>;
  }

  // Safely render application.
  return <>{children}</>;
}

/**
 * Root component of the whole project.
 */
export function Root() {
  return (
    <SDKProvider>
      <Loader>
        <App/>
      </Loader>
    </SDKProvider>
  );
}
```

You could probably ask why we should use component like `Loader`. The problem
is, as long as SDK initialization is asynchronous (some of its components should
send requests to native app), we could not determine which properties its
components should have. That is the reason, why `SDKProvider` can not provide
valid `components` property until initialization is completed.

As the result, all hooks which return component instances will throw an error
as long as they could not get their component from `components` property. That
is the reason, why these hooks should not be called until SDK is initialized.

### When init is done

When initialization was completed successfully, do not forget to
call `webApp.ready` function. This will notify native application about current
Web App is ready to be displayed.

```typescript jsx
import {useWebApp} from '@twa.js/sdk-react';
import React, {useEffect} from 'react';

function App() {
  const webApp = useWebApp();

  useEffect(() => {
    webApp.ready();
  }, [webApp]);

  return <div>Here is my App</div>;
}
```

## Hooks and HOCs

[//]: # (### Theme)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (There are some cases, when it is required to use theme parameters information)

[//]: # (even when SDK is not ready yet. For example, you would probably want to)

[//]: # (know theme colors to render app loader with appropriate colors.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (For this purpose, hook `useThemeFromLocation` is used:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```typescript jsx)

[//]: # (import {useThemeFromLocation} from '@twa.js/sdk-react';)

[//]: # (import React, {useEffect} from 'react';)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (function App&#40;&#41; {)

[//]: # (  const theme = useThemeFromLocation&#40;&#41;;)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (  return <div>Background color: {theme.backgroundColor}</div>;)

[//]: # (})

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Internally, this hook uses `twa-theme-params`s package `extractFromLocation`)

[//]: # (function, which extracts theme information from current window location.)

[//]: # (### Other)

Library provides list of dead simple hooks and HOCs for each SDK component.
Returned instances are always the same, but force updates will be called
in case, something changed in component.

> **WARNING**: In case, you use HOCs, pay attention to the fact, passed
> components are always the same instances. This may lead to problems with
> `PureComponent`s as long as they will not see any changes in references.
> Do not create new components instances as long as it will lead to new
> problems connected with events listening done during SDK initialization
> process.
