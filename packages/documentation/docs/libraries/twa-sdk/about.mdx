# @twa.js/sdk

Made from scratch TypeScript library for communication with Telegram Web Apps
functionality.

Code of this library was written with aim to make developers communication with
Telegram Web Apps way easier. It contains a lot of separate components which are
responsible for their own part of Telegram Web Apps ecosystem.

Before starting to use SDK, we highly recommend learning Web Apps
[documentation](../../introduction/web-apps) to understand platform concepts.

<LibraryBadges pkg={'@twa.js/sdk'}/>

## Installation

<NpmInstall pkg={'@twa.js/sdk'}/>

## Init

According to logic, this package provides full control over its lifecycle,
its initialization is on developer's shoulders. It means, that there are no
already initialized global components which could be used by developer, they
should be created by him.

To make developers life easier, package contains special function called `init`,
which returns initialized components instances:

```typescript
import {init} from '@twa.js/sdk';

init().then(components => {
  // Now we have all initialized components.
  const {mainButton, viewport} = components;

  // Add main button event click which will lead to
  // application expansion.
  mainButton.on('click', () => viewport.expand());

  // Update main button information and show it.
  mainButton
    .setColor('#ff0000')
    .setTextColor('#ffffff')
    .setText('Expand')
    .enable()
    .show()
    .commit();
});
```

### Options

#### `debug: boolean`

Enables debug mode which leads to more debugging information sent by SDK:

```typescript
init({debug: true});
```

#### `checkCompat: boolean`

Enables mode in which calls of methods not supported by current version
of Web App will lead to thrown errors. This mode is recommended to be used
and enabled by default.

```typescript
init({checkCompat: true});
```

#### `targetOrigin: string`

This option is directly passed to `Bridge` during its initialization. It
restricts lists of parent iframes allowed to receive data from current
application.

```typescript
init({targetOrigin: 'https://web.telegram.org'});
```

## Components

All components in this package are supposed to be used as singletons. It means,
you should not create several instances of same component and use them even
if it is not forbidden. But in this case, there is no warranty, everything
will work fine.

The reason is, each component class stores its state locally and class instances
are not synchronized between each other. So, for example, in case, you create
2 instances of `Popup` component and one of them calls `open()` method, it
will change its `isOpened` property to `true`, but the second instance
of `Popup` will not know about it and will still return `false` value.

To avoid possible problems, you can rely on package's `init` function which
provides initialized components which are enough to use across application.

### Events

Component instances use common way of events listening through `on` and `off`
functions:

```typescript
const listener = (...args) => {
  console.log(...args);
};
component.on(event, listener); // add listener.
component.off(event, listener); // remove listener.
```

Example with `BackButton` component:

```typescript
import {BackButton} from '@twa.js/sdk';

const backButton = new BackButton();
backButton.on('click', () => {
  console.log('Back button clicked.');
});
```

You can find list of supported events in components own documentations.

### Methods support

Almost each component is capable of checking whether its method is supported by
current Web App version or not. To check if some methods are supported, you
should use `{Component}.supports()` function. For example:

```typescript
import {BackButton} from '@twa.js/sdk';
import {init} from '@twa.js/bridge';

let backButton = new BackButton(init(), '6.0');
console.log(backButton.supports('show')); // false

backButton = new BackButton(init(), '6.3');
console.log(backButton.supports('hide')); // true
```

It is recommended to use this functionality before calling some component method
as long as this will make you sure, it will work.

List of supported methods by components is described in each component's
documentation.
