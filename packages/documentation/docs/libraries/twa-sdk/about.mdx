# twa-sdk

Made from scratch TypeScript library for communication with Telegram Web Apps
functionality.

Code of this library was written with aim to make developers communication with
Telegram Web Apps way easier. It contains a lot of separate components which are
responsible for their own part of Telegram Web Apps ecosystem.

Before starting to use SDK, we highly recommend learning Web Apps
[documentation](/docs/category/introduction) to understand platform concepts.

<LibraryBadges pkg={'twa-sdk'}/>

## Installation

<NpmInstall pkg={'twa-sdk'}/>

## Init

According to logic, this package provides full control over its lifecycle,
its initialization is on developer's shoulders. It means, that there are no
already initialized global components which could be used by developer, they
should be created by him.

To make developers life easier, package contains special function called `init`,
which returns initialized components instances:

```typescript
import {init} from 'twa-sdk';

init().then(components => {
  // Now we have all initialized components.
  const {mainButton, viewport} = components;

  // Add main button event click which will lead to
  // application expansion.
  mainButton.on('click', () => viewport.expand());

  // Update main button information and show it.
  mainButton
    .setColor('#ff0000')
    .setTextColor('#ffffff')
    .setText('Expand')
    .enable()
    .show()
    .commit();
});
```

To enable debug mode, use `true` value as argument:

```typescript
// Init with debug mode.
init(true);
```

In case, you want to initialize components with your own props, you should
pass object to `init` function:

```typescript
init({
  props: {
    bridge: {debug: true},
    backButton: {isVisible: true},
    // ...
    webApp: {platform: 'tdesktop', backgroundColor: '#FF0233', ...}
  }
});
```

## Components

All components in this package are supposed to be
used as singletons. It means, you should not create several instances of
same component and use them even if it is not forbidden. But in this case,
there is no warranty, everything will work fine.

The reason is, each component class stores its state locally and class instances
are not synchronized between each other. So, for example, in case, you create
2 instances of `Popup` component and one of them calls `show()` function, it
will change its `isOpened` property to `true`, but the second instance
of `Popup` will not know about it and will still return `false` value.

To avoid possible problems, you can rely on package's `init` function which
provides initialized components which are enough to use across application.

:::info

<p>
  Some components which require usage of <code>Bridge</code> functionality can
  accept its custom instance in constructor. In case, <code>Bridge</code> is not
  passed, component will create it via <code>init()</code> method
  from <NpmLink pkg={'twa-bridge'}/> package. We recommend passing your own
  single instance of <code>Bridge</code> to avoid unexpected behaviour or
  errors.
</p>

### Events

Component instances use common way of events listening through `on` and `off`
functions:

```typescript
const listener = (...args) => {
  console.log(...args);
};
component.on(event, listener); // add listener.
component.off(event, listener); // remove listener.
```

Example with `BackButton` component:

```typescript
import {BackButton} from 'twa-sdk';

const backButton = new BackButton();
backButton.on('click', () => {
  console.log('Back button clicked.');
});
```

You can find list of supported events in components own documentations.

### Methods support

Almost each component is capable of checking whether its method is supported by
passed Web App version or not. To check if some methods are supported, you
should use `{Component}.supports()` function. For example:

```typescript
import {BackButton} from 'twa-sdk';

console.log(BackButton.supports('show', '6.0')); // false
console.log(BackButton.supports('hide', '6.3')); // true
```

It is recommended to use this functionality before calling some component method
as long as this will make you sure, it will work. Component itself is not
checking if method is supported by current Web App version, what could lead to
issues.

List of supported methods by components is described in each component's
documentation.
