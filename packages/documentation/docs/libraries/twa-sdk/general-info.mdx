# twa-sdk <sup><img src="https://static.npmjs.com/255a118f56f5346b97e56325a1217a16.svg" alt="drawing" width="20"/></sup>

Made from scratch TypeScript library for communication with Telegram Web Apps
functionality.

Code of this library was written with aim to make developers communication with
Telegram Web Apps way easier. It contains a lot of separate components which are
responsible for their own part of Telegram Web Apps ecosystem.

Before starting to use SDK, we highly recommend learning Web Apps
[documentation](/docs/category/introduction) to understand platform concepts.

## Usage

### Init

According to logic, this package provides full control over its lifecycle,
its initialization is on developer's shoulders. It means, that there are no
already initialized global components which could be used by developer, they
should be created by him.

To make developers life easier, package contains special function called `init`,
which returns initialized components instances:

```typescript
import {init} from 'twa-sdk';

init().then(components => {
  // Now we have all initialized components.
  const {mainButton, viewport} = components;

  // Add main button event click which will lead to
  // application expansion.
  mainButton.on('click', () => viewport.expand());

  // Update main button information and show it.
  mainButton
    .setColor('#ff0000')
    .setTextColor('#ffffff')
    .setText('Expand')
    .enable()
    .show()
    .commit();
});
```

To enable debug mode, use `true` value as argument:

```typescript
// Init with debug mode.
init(true);
```

In case, you want to initialize components with your own props, you should
pass object to `init` function:

```typescript
init({
  props: {
    bridge: {debug: true},
    backButton: {isVisible: true},
    // ...
    webApp: {platform: 'tdesktop', backgroundColor: '#FF0233', ...}
  }
});
```

## Components

All components in this package are supposed to be
used as singletons. It means, you should not create several instances of
same component and use them even if it is not forbidden. But in this case,
there is no warranty, everything will work fine.

The reason is, each component class stores its state locally and class instances
are not synchronized between each other. So, for example, in case, you create
2 instances of `Popup` component and one of them calls `show()` function, it
will change its `isOpened` property to `true`, but the second instance
of `Popup` will not know about it and will still return `false` value.

To avoid possible problems, you can rely on package's `init` function which
provides initialized components which are enough to use across application.

:::info

Some components which require usage of `Bridge` functionality can
accept its custom instance in constructor. In case, `Bridge` is not passed,
component will create it via `init()` method from `twa-bridge` package. We
recommend passing your own single instance of `Bridge` to avoid unexpected
behaviour or errors.
