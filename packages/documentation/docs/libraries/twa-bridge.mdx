# twa-bridge

Package which provides utilities to simplify communication between
Web App and Telegram native application. It also solves some across-platform
data difference problems to protect developers code and save their time.

<LibraryBadges pkg={'twa-bridge'}/>

## Installation

<NpmInstall pkg={'twa-bridge'}/>

## Init

`Bridge` component has rather simple API. Its main purpose is to provide
communication layer between Telegram native and client applications, so you
could call native methods and receive events from Telegram application.

To start using bridge, it is enough to use `init` method:

```typescript
import {init} from 'twa-bridge';

const bridge = init();
```

This function will append special handler to global window object, which is
used by Telegram native application. It is allowed to use it as many times
as required as long as this function will just reuse once created event emitter
and event receiving function.

## Debugging

`Bridge` supports debug mode which outputs additional log messages into console.
By default, this mode is disabled. To enable it, it is required to pass
`debug: true` while creating new `Bridge` instance.

```typescript
import {init} from 'twa-bridge';

const bridge = init({debug: true});
```

Or, in case when instance already exists, just change its `debug` property
to `true`.

```typescript
import {init} from 'twa-bridge';

const bridge = init();
bridge.debug = true;
```

After debug mode is enabled, bridge logs additional information about received
and sent events into console.

## Target origin

In case, current bridge instance is used in browser environment (iframe),
we use such function as `window.parent.postMessage` which requires passing
target origin to prevent sending events to untrusted parent iframes.

By default, bridge uses such origin as `https://web.telegram.org`. To allow
sending events to other origins, you should use `targetOrigin` option:

```typescript
const unsafeBridge = init({targetOrigin: '*'});
// or
const safeBridge = init({targetOrigin: 'https://myendpoint.org'});
```

Additionally, you could use `postEvent`s `targetOrigin` option. This will
override origin passed during initialization:

```typescript
const bridge = init({targetOrigin: '*'});
bridge.postEvent('web_app_close', {targetOrigin: 'https://myendpoint.org'})
```

It is highly recommended not to override this value as long as it could lead
to security issues. Update this value only in test purposes.

## Calling methods

### With `Bridge`

To call Web Apps methods, it is enough to call `Bridge`s `postEvent` method.
This method automatically finds correct way of sending event which depends
on current environment. Let's take a look on simple example:

```typescript
import {init} from 'twa-bridge';

const bridge = init();

// Close current application.
bridge.postEvent('web_app_close')
```

Some events don't require parameters, and they can be called without additional
second parameter which represents event payload. But there are some events,
which have arguments:

```typescript
import {init} from 'twa-bridge';

const bridge = init();

// Open new popup.
bridge.postEvent('web_app_open_popup', {
  title: 'Web Apps Notification',
  message: 'I love Web Apps',
  buttons: [{type: 'ok', id: 'ok'}]
});
```

### Without `Bridge`

This library allows calling methods without creating new `Bridge` instance. To
perform this action, you should use `postEvent` function which has the same
type as `bridge.postEvent` (actually, bridge uses `postEvent` function
internally):

```typescript
import {postEvent} from 'twa-bridge';

postEvent('web_app_setup_back_button', {is_visible: true});
```

Nevertheless, sometimes you need to handle event sent from native app which is
emitted as a response to posted event. For example, you would like to
call `web_app_request_theme` event. As a result, native app will emit
`theme_changed` event. Using default bridge init flow, this event will
be captured by bridge instance. We can't say the same about bare `postEvent`
function, so, do not forget about response event (if it exists) handling
process.

## Listening to events

Events tracking is rather simple thing too. For this purpose, we could
use such methods as `on` and `subscribe`. To remove event listeners, we
use `off` and `unsubscribe`:

```typescript
import {BridgeEventListener, init} from 'twa-bridge';
import {GlobalListener} from 'twa-core';

const bridge = init();
const listener: BridgeEventListener<'viewport_changed'> = payload => {
  console.log('Viewport changed:', payload)
};
const globalListener: GlobalListener = (event, ...args) => {
  console.log('Event was called:', event, ...args);
};

// Add event listener.
bridge.on('viewport_changed', listener);

// Add listener for all events.
bridge.subscribe(globalListener);

// Remove event listeners.
bridge.off('viewport_changed', listener);
bridge.unsubscribe(globalListener);
```

## Lower level control options

Previously, we used such function as `init` almost without any parameters,
but this method supports some more additional options.

### `defineReceiver: boolean`

*Default: `true`*

Settings this value to `true`, `init` function will call such function
as `defineEventReceiver` which defines global function, handling events
from Telegram application and emitting window `message` event.

It is safe to use this function as many times as required. This function
will run only once.

In spite of it is not recommended, you could set this option to `false`.
This will lead to not handling of events in iOS, Android and desktop
versions of Telegram, unless some additional actions are done.

### `emitter: GlobalEventEmitter`

Bridge itself is not listening to window `message` event or events sent
from Telegram native application directly. It expects passing
[event emitter](https://github.com/Telegram-Web-Apps/twa/blob/master/packages/bridge/src/event-receiver/global.ts#L18)
that is responsible for this kind of job.

This way of working with events allows us to normally subscribe to and
unsubscribe from such events.

In case, this property is not passed, function will create required event
emitter which will be shared between other `Bridge` instances.

## Checking method support

Bridge itself does not check if Web App method is supported by current
version of Web App. To check, if method is supported, you could use `supports`
function:

```typescript
import {supports} from 'twa-bridge';

supports('web_app_trigger_haptic_feedback', '6.0'); // false
supports('web_app_trigger_haptic_feedback', '6.1'); // true
```

It is recommended to use this function before calling Web Apps methods to
prevent application from stalling.

## Higher-level control

As long as bridge provides only low-level control, we recommend using
[SDK](twa-sdk/about), which implements bridge methods. It also provides
additional parameters checks, more intuitive method names and easier usage.
